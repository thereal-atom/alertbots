# alertbots
This is a discord bot which can send an entry alert for a stock or crypto to multiple servers at once, basically a cross post bot

You can do commands like .setchannel <@role> so the bot will start sending alerts there and .remchannel so it will stop. You can also have custom formats and custom embed colours all done by command. I typically make these custom for alerters with custom avatar and name and sometimes custom commands.
